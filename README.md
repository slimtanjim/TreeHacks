## Inspiration
The idea for this website came about during a group project where we were exploring the world of influencer marketing. We noticed that finding the right influencer for a campaign could be a time-consuming and challenging process, especially when it came to understanding their YouTube statistics. We wanted to create a website that would make it easy to harvest and analyze YouTube data to better inform influencer marketing campaigns.

## What it does
The website that we developed allows users to paste a YouTube link and quickly receive detailed statistics on the channel's performance, including viewership demographics, engagement rates, and content trends. While the current version of the website only offers data harvesting, we plan to expand its capabilities to include brand matching in the future.

## How we built it
To build this website, we used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to design the user interface and make the website easy to use. With just a search box to paste a youtube link and then the button to get all the stats related to the video and the channel we can get a bullet points version of what the stats of the channel are. 

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges that we faced was figuring out how to use an api and make requests with it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to get the youtube api work which was one of the core part for the project for it to function 

## What we learned
36 hours is seems like a long time but when we start time flies by really fast. We started with a big idea and had to pivot a lot and remain calm and focus on a singular goal one step at a time. Pare-programming was a fun experiment we did as I think it cut down on dev time a bit. 

## What's next for YouTube Stats 
Next we will be focusing on the STATS button where we can see store the data and display the channel names and rankings based on a variety of points such as most views, comments, subscriber counts etc.
